## Motivation and Purpose

## Description of the data

## Research questions and usage scenarios

### Target Audience Persona
**John Miller**, a senior trade policy analyst at the Canadian Ministry of Economic Development, is tasked with evaluating the economic impact of potential U.S. tariffs on key Canadian industries. With the recent announcement of a **25% tariff** on Canadian exports, he needs to understand which industries and provinces will be most affected, the projected decline in trade, and the broader economic implications. His goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** to policymakers on possible countermeasures and support programs for affected sectors.

### Overall Goal
John wants to use the **dashboard** to simulate the impact of a **25% tariff** on Canada’s exports to the United States and identify which **industries and provinces** will experience the greatest disruptions.

### Tasks and Walkthrough

- **[Explore]** the overall trade relationship between Canada and the U.S.
  - John accesses an **interactive map** displaying Canada’s exports, imports, and net exports with the U.S.
  - He can switch between **total exports, imports, and net export balance** using interactive filters.

- **[Compare]** different industries to assess vulnerability.
  - A **treemap visualization** shows Canada’s exports to the U.S. by industry, helping him quickly identify which **sectors contribute the most** to trade.
  - He notices that some industries, like **energy and manufacturing**, dominate the export market.

- **[Simulate]** the impact of a **25% tariff** on key industries.
  - John applies a **tariff simulation filter**, and a **stacked bar chart** updates to reflect projected export values **before and after** the tariff.
  - He can compare **pre-tariff and post-tariff** scenarios for each industry, helping him gauge the magnitude of the potential trade disruption.

- **[Identify]** regional impact.
  - A **provincial map visualization** allows John to see how different **provinces contribute to exports** and which regions are most dependent on trade with the U.S.
  - He switches to a **by-product view**, where **pie charts** within each province help break down trade composition, making it easier to see which industries are at risk in each province.

- **[Report and Recommend]**
  - John downloads a **summary report** with key insights and visualizations to present to policymakers.
  - He drafts a proposal advising potential **countermeasures**, such as **export diversification strategies** or **subsidies for affected industries**.

### Outcome
With this dashboard, **John can provide data-backed recommendations** to policymakers, ensuring **proactive economic strategies** that mitigate risks from a potential trade war.
