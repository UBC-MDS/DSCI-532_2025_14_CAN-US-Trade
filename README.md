This project is part of the coursework for DSCI 532 Data Visualization II, a course of the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## About this project

This project aims to develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes trade relations between Canada and the United States.
The recent announcement of a 25% tariff on Canadian imports into the United States has raised concerns about its potential economic consequences on both sides of the border. 
Economic analysts must quickly assess which industries and provinces will be most affected, the magnitude of trade reductions, and the long-term economic risks. 
However, trade data is often complex and hard to interpret, making it difficult to derive practical insights efficiently.

Thus, we hope to develop an informative dashboard that will help economic analysts explore historical trade trends, assess vulnerabilities, and simulate potential disruptions caused by tariffs.
